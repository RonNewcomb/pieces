                I was part of a team to modernize a single legacy product. I
                immediately created a proof of concept of running React within
                the ASPX server-rendered UI in order to modernize its bar chart
                styles, then with creating a collection of CSS stylesheets that
                could be swapped out for the old ones depending on which client
                an installation was for. I helped architect and implement a
                completely new dashboard. About this time our team switched from
                TFS to Git and from sprocs to an ORM, so I helped mentor my
                peers who were unfamiliar with each. I participated in UX
                meetings about a brand new UI and API to wrap the legacy
                backend. For the new API I wrote many functional tests as well
                as much of its authorization code. I created a new permissions
                system in our legacy product including writing database
                migration scripts to move from the old to the new. I helped
                champion modern ways of writing clean code, showing examples
                from Martin Fowler's Refactoring text, favoring LINQ and other
                fluent-interface code over explicit loops, and many minor ways
                of reducing boilerplate to highlight a piece of code's purpose.
                Throughout my time here I documented in Confluence new
                workflows, frontend environment setups, local IIS certification
                setups, and even some lesser understood parts of the legacy
                system.

              <p>
                I worked in a variety of projects and team compositions over the
                years at Imprezzio. First was a CRM for a large insurance
                provider on a Flash / C# / SQL Server stack on a team of about a
                dozen globally dispersed developers. When the client sunsetted
                the project, I was chosen to be the sole developer supporting
                it, since I was full-stack and reliable. During the sunset I
                split their federated database from one physical server to two,
                monitoring traffic load for, and then solving, cross-talk
                problems. I later had ownership of two smaller projects. I
                worked closely with Accouting on our custom Accounts Receivable
                software (C# and SQL Server), particularly on fine-tuning their
                reports and ensuring correctness in the nightly batch processes.
                Later I was "the dev" for our PM for our client-facing
                LeadAlerts product. I was solely responsible for a NetSuite
                integration project lasting a few months, with no oversight
                beyond "does it work". I jumped in on a mobile project of three
                people that had stalled and was threatening to miss deadline.
                Multiple hasty demo projects, a couple of weekend "hackathon"
                sprints, and several late-night devops round out the list.
                Finally I became the de-facto tech lead on our refactored CRM's
                Angular UI, mentoring a rotating cast of devs of highly various
                tech backgrounds.
